After a week of hacking away, I can finally say that I have successfully finished my CLI Data Gem Project. When I started this project I wanted to build a CLI application that would display the 3 major U.S. indices, their current value and the percetn change. Unfortunately, after building out the entire CLI and setting up the index file, I found that every financial page had data that consitently changed. THis made it hard to scrape the information as everytime I ran it my code would break. Instead, I decided to go with a completely different idea. I have been bit by the travel bug lately. I have been trying to figure out a place to go on vacation towards the end of the year. So I figured why not make a travel app CLI that would give a list of countries and a brief description of each country. After scouring multiple websites to find pages that had good scrapable data, I stumbled upon the Lonely Planet Website. This website is fantastic. It provides so many articles that contain some of the best locations to travel, best foods in each country, activities to do in each country, and much much more. I went with the 10 best countries to travel to. 
When I built my CLI I greeted the user and provided a list of the 10 coutnries. Once the list had been displayed, I asked the user to enter an input of 1-10. Each number corresponds to a country and lists out a description of that country. Then I ask the user to enter another number, type 'list' to see the list again, or type 'exit' to leave teh program.
Overall, this project was a very big learning curve for me. I became very comfortable with github and the processes it entails. My confidence in my ability to code has also gone up after succesfully building an application on my own. I'm looking forward to continuing my Learn Journey!
