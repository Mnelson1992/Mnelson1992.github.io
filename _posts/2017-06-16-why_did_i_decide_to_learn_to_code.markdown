Let me start by saying that I am a big lover of efficiency. Any time that I'm working on a project for work, I try to find the most efficient way to complete it. It is because of this love for efficiency that I became hooked on coding. You see I work for a financial services company where Excel spreadsheets run the office. There is a spreadsheet for everything, even for the snack closet! Working with spreadsheets on a daily basis, I thought I was the king at manipulating them, designing them, and writting formulas. 

Then one day my boss came to me and dropped a flash drive on my desk, "Figure this out and I'll buy you lunch" she said. Easy enough I thought. After a couple hours of my eyes being glued to the monitor I figured out what type of programming they used to make the spreadsheet. They used Excel's VBA function. Seeing how much easier and efficient this would make my work I became enamored with every aspect of VBA. I spent the next few weeks reading about VBA, practicing my limited VBA skills, and showing the office how to use it. 

I decided to push myself and learn the basics of a Java and see if there were anyways I could apply code to make life efficient in other ways. After spending 3 weeks lost in Flatiron's free Java course, I knoew I had to make the move to coding. So that pretty much sums up my desire to learn code. I'm looking forward to starting this journey and seeing where it will take me.
