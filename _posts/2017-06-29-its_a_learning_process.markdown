Coding is probably one of the most challenging subjects that I have learnt. Just like everyone else, I have great days where I think I am a coding king, and then of course I have days where I struggle. I have gained a deep appreciation for seeing those rewarding words of 0 errors at the end of a very difficult coding lab. The other night when I saw those words appear in my terminal, I started to realize that the key to learning code succesfully is to go through the motions and not get bogged down when something doesn't make sense. It all comes together at the end. This made me reflect on my time learning code, specifically what learning code has taught me. 

Coding has taught me 3 very important things:
       1.) Patience
       2.) There are different ways to solve a problem
       3.) Learn from others

In order to learn to code, in my opinion, it is cricual to take your time and have patience. Realizing that grasping a coding concept, or becoming a coding wiz takes time. I learnt this lesson the hard way and I would get down on myself for not immediately being able to solve a lab. There were times where I would think that coding wasn't for me. Then one day I saw that someone had the same issue that I was having with a lab. One of the responses to her question was to keep her head up and that everyone struggles at first. This showed me that I neede to keep going patiently, and it will all click in the end. 

When I approached all of my labs I believed that there was only one way to succesfully solve the lab. However, when it comes to writting code, there are many ways to solve a problem. Working with one of the instructors I found that I was overthinking. The way that I try to solve a lab is completely different from the way that another student/instructor may try to solve a lab. This leads me to my third lesson. It is very important to learn from others, especially when it comes to learning code. Someone may have a way of explaining things that make it easier to understand the section that you are learning. For example, the other night I was struggling with the position taken Tic Tac Toe lab. One of the instructors did a screen share with me and walked me throguh one of the ways he solved the lab and it all made sense. Immediately after finishing the screen share I tried his method of solving the lab and came up with my own.

Learning to code is most definitely a challenge. However, it is a challenge that can easily be overcome with determination and persistence. Hope this post is a little motivation booster for my fellow Flatiorn coders!

Keep coding!
