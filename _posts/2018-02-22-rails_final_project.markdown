I have finally finished building my rails portfolio project. For me, this was the hardest of the portfolio projects so far. I decided to make a Recipe CookBook. A user of the CookBook can log in through Facebook, or log in the regular way (email and password). Once logged in, the user can create a recipe and fill out the the form and add the recipe to their recipes. The form contains space for the user to fill out the recipe name, instructions, cook time, and ingredients. Once the user has created a recipe they will be able to view the recipe, edit it, view the ingredients, and delete the recipe. 

This project presented me with many challenges and learning curves. When I first started I thought it would be a walk in the park.  However, as I kept building the project I encountered more and more problems. Each one would require me to debug and identify where the error was and how to fix it. Overall, I believe that this was one of the best projects for me to experience in my development careers. It showed me that I am able to debug problems and has given me a lot of confidence in my ability to write applications
