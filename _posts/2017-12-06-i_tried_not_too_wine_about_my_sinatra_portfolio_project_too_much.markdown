Sinatra was the part of the curriculum where the light bulb went off in my head. Actually being able to see how the background code affected a web page gave me a better understanding of all the lessons and sections prior to Sinatra. The file structure made so much sense and being able to play with html in the code made for quite a bit of fun. I had a little trouble thinking of an idea for my Sinatra Portfolio Project. However, after much consideration I decided to make an application that allowed a user to keep track of their wine collection. 

I started this project by drawing out the tables, application controllers and models on paper. Once I had that down I then began to write out the routes that each application would have. I created 2 controller, a user controller and a bottle controller. After all the practice we had with our labs and other projects leading up to the portfolio project, I was more than confident to build my own routes without looking at prior lessons. 

Once everything had been built and all of my routes worked, I moved on to basic styling. Applying simple html styling to the view pages. Although very basic, this CRUD application has given me so much confidence in my coding abilities. I can't wait to see what I can build when my skills become more advanced.
