This past week and a half I have been working on the HTML and CSS section of the Online program. After many videos, endless stylesheets, and a few verification checks I finally completed the section. I have to say that I much prefer HTML over CSS. HTML makes more sense to me. CSS ont he other hand, has so many endless features and different ways to format things. However, there are a few things that I do enjoy about CSS. I like the idea of responsive formatting. Something about the having the ability to always be one step ahead and having a plan for smaller screens excites me. A simple responsive layout starts with the media tag then lists conditonals

For example:

```
@media only screen and (max-width: 790px)
```

I am now moving onto Procedural Ruby. The first few labs have been a great refresher and gives me a little boost of confidence when I can build a method right off the bat without having to Google certain things. I did, however, struggle a little with the if statements lab today. I had it set in my mind that the three types of statements worked a certain way and all had to follow the same rules. After half an hour of realizing I wasn't going anywhere I resorted to asking a few questions. I realized that if and elsif need to have a conditional and a return and that else doesn't need a conditional. After making the necessary changes my code was passing all the tests.
