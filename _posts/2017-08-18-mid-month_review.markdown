It is amazing how fast a week can go by. Especially, when you are working full time and coding everyday. This week has been a very succesful one for me. I hit goals that I had set for myself in terms of coding. I finished Procedural Ruby, and am now working on the Object Orientation section of Ruby. I found Regex to be quite a challenge. The basics are pretty simple to understand, however, there are so many variations and ways to solve the Regex lab, that it required you to think outside of the box. Through a lot of trial (and the help of the Flatiron TA's) and error I was able to get the lab passing. 

I think I'm going to like OO Ruby. It makes a lot of sense and it is easier to write than procedural ruby. However, that may be because I have completed procedural ruby and have a better understanding of teh Ruby language itself. I have family visiting from out of town this weekend, so I am going to try and complete a few lessons in the mornings before spending teh day with them.

Total Lessons Completed: 213
Karma Points: 64
