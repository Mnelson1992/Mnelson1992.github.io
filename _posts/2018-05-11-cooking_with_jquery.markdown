With each portfolio project that I begin, I always worry too much about the planning in the beggining. This often leads me to think that my idea isn't going to work, and then I freak out and come up with another to ulimately come to the same result and try find another idea. This cycle always happens, regardless of the project. However, with the Rails App with a jQuery front end project, I found that this wasn't the case. With this prject, we were tasked with adding on to our prevous Rails portfolio project. Learning Javascript and jQuery was a bit intimidating, but in teh end I learnt many valuable lessons.  I utilized AMS to help serialize the attributes. This makes it easier to convert your data in JSON. With that converted, it was pretty much learning how to listen for the correct node and add it to the DOM. THis project also showed me jus how valuable HTML and CSS are in Web Development. My knowledge of both made it a lot easier to build out my desired functionality and come up with a great finished product.
